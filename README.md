# Making Local-Search-Based k-means Clustering Even Faster
This repository is the official implementation of [Making Local-Search-Based k-means Clustering Even Faster]

## Usage

The specific algorithm is implemented in the local_search_modal.py file.

To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, run 'main_runtime.py'

## The coil100 and usps datasets can be download from the website http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/MLData.html

## The ORL is a widely used face database, and can be download from the website http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/FaceData.html

## The interface designed for the UCR time series.

download and read the UCR dataset(https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/)

In the main file, just set the file_name to the time series file name you want to test.

**Requirements**: NumPy, scipy, matplotlib, math, cv2, pandas,PIL
